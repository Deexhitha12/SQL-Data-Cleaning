Standardized Date Formats: Converted the SaleDate column into a consistent DATE format for improved analysis and reporting.

Populated Missing Property Addresses: Updated null values in the PropertyAddress column by matching ParcelID values with existing records using ISNULL and JOIN.

Split Address Columns:

Extracted PropertySplitAddress and PropertyAddressCity from the PropertyAddress column using SUBSTRING.
Extracted OwnerSplitAddress, OwnerCity, and OwnerState from the OwnerAddress column using the PARSENAME function.
Standardized Boolean Columns: Replaced Y/N values in the SoldAsVacant column with Yes/No for better readability and consistency.

Removed Duplicate Records: Used a CTE with the ROW_NUMBER() window function to identify and delete duplicate rows based on columns like ParcelID, SalePrice, and SaleDate.

Dropped Unnecessary Columns: Deleted redundant columns (TaxDistrict, BuildingValue, OwnerAddress, and PropertyAddress) to improve query performance and storage efficiency.

Analyzed and Grouped Data: Performed grouping and aggregation operations (e.g., distinct counts of SoldAsVacant values) to identify patterns and inconsistencies in the dataset.
